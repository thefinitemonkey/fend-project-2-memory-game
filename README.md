# Memory Game Project

This is the Memory Game project for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nano-Degree. This project uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a memory matching game.

Load the page in your browser to play. Click any two tiles that have not been matched in an attempt to find matches. If tiles do not match, they will be hidden again after one second. You have up to 18 moves for a three star rank, 21 moves for a two star rank, and 24 moves for a one star rank.

Completing the game will present a confirmation dialog with you game details and the option to start again. The reset button at the top of the game can reset at any time.
